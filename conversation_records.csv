This initiative is part of the Chichester Local Plan, which acknowledges that projected growth in road journeys, due to new housing and employment, will increase traffic pressure on the local road network, particularly at the A27 junctions【4:0†source】【4:2†source】.

Key elements of the strategy include:

1. **Improvements to Junctions**: The plan includes upgrades to six junctions on the A27 Chichester Bypass, which are critical for managing traffic flow and reducing queuing times【4:0†source】【4:2†source】.

2. **Funding through Development Contributions**: As there is currently insufficient public funding for these improvements, the Council is relying on securing financial contributions from new developments in the area. This is facilitated through Planning Obligations (Section 106 Agreements) that require developers to contribute to the necessary infrastructure improvements【4:1†source】【4:11†source】.

3. **Promotion of Sustainable Travel**: The strategy also emphasizes encouraging sustainable modes of transport, such as walking, cycling, and public transport. This includes targeted investments in local transport infrastructure and measures to promote behavioral changes in travel choices【4:2†source】【4:6†source】.

4. **Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL)**: Funding from the CIL will be utilized to support these transport measures, alongside other potential funding sources【4:18†source】.

5. **Monitoring and Phasing**: The effectiveness of these measures will be monitored, and the phasing of development will be coordinated with the delivery of the proposed transport improvements【4:4†source】【4:19†source】.

Overall, the approach is designed to mitigate the traffic impacts of anticipated growth in the region while promoting a shift towards more sustainable travel options.
