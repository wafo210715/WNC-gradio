    "Assistant Response": "Response: The authorities in Chichester are addressing traffic management on the A27 through a coordinated package of improvements aimed at enhancing road capacity, reducing congestion, and improving safety at the junctions along the Chichester Bypass. This initiative is part of the Chichester Local Plan, which acknowledges that projected growth in road journeys, due to new housing and employment, will increase traffic pressure on the local road network, particularly at the A27 junctions\u30104:0\u2020source\u3011\u30104:2\u2020source\u3011.\n\nKey elements of the strategy include:\n\n1. **Improvements to Junctions**: The plan includes upgrades to six junctions on the A27 Chichester Bypass, which are critical for managing traffic flow and reducing queuing times\u30104:0\u2020source\u3011\u30104:2\u2020source\u3011.\n\n2. **Funding through Development Contributions**: As there is currently insufficient public funding for these improvements, the Council is relying on securing financial contributions from new developments in the area.
