This initiative is driven by the need to protect the Harbour's ecology, which has been adversely affected by excess nutrients leading to issues such as eutrophication and algal blooms.\n\nThe concept of nutrient neutrality requires that any new development must not increase the nutrient levels discharged into the Harbour. To achieve this, developers must prepare a nitrogen budget as part of their planning applications, demonstrating that their development will be nutrient neutral. This often involves implementing mitigation measures, such as converting land from high nitrogen input uses (like agriculture) to lower input uses (like woodland or wetlands)\u30104:0\u2020source\u3011\u30104:1\u2020source\u3011.\n\nNatural England has provided guidance on how to calculate these nutrient budgets and has updated its advice periodically to reflect the latest scientific understanding. As part of this process, the local planning authority (LPA) must ensure that any proposed development does not lead to an increase in nitrogen levels, even in small amounts\u30104:0\u2020source\u3011\u30104:1\u2020source\u3011.\n\nIn summary, nutrient neutrality is a crucial framework for ensuring that new developments in Chichester do not harm the ecological integrity of the Harbour, thereby supporting its conservation and compliance with environmental regulations\u30104:0\u2020source\u3011\u30104:1\u2020source\u3011.", "timestamp": "2024-10-01T13:54:19"}], "recorded_at": "2024-10-01T13:54:29.812046"}

Here are some promising locations:\n\n1. **West of Chichester**: This area is bounded by Centurion Way and the railway line, close to the city center. It has good accessibility and is relatively self-contained in terms of landscape. The site has the potential to deliver a large strategic development of up to 1,600 homes\u30108:3\u2020source\u3011.\n\n2. **Shopwyke**: Located to the east of Chichester, this site has previously been used for aggregate and minerals extraction. It is planned to deliver around 500 homes within a parkland setting, alongside employment uses and community amenities\u30108:5\u2020source\u3011.\n\n3. **Southbourne**: Identified as a settlement hub, Southbourne is suitable for strategic development. The local plan proposes around 300 homes in this area, emphasizing community facilities and improved access\u30108:18\u2020source\u3011.\n\n4. **Westhampnett/North East Chichester**: This site has potential for strategic development, with the possibility of delivering 500 homes. It is close to employment opportunities and has good access to the A27\u30108:9\u2020source\u3011.\n\nEach of these locations has its advantages, including accessibility, proximity to existing infrastructure, and the potential for community amenities.

These pollutants enter the Harbour through runoff from agricultural and urban areas, as well as discharges from the sewerage system\u30104:0\u2020source\u3011\u30104:1\u2020source\u3011.\n\nThe shallow nature of the Harbour, combined with limited tidal flushing and the absence of large rivers, means that these nutrients tend to accumulate. This leads to excessive algal growth, which forms dense mats over the mudflats, reducing oxygen levels in the sediment and adversely affecting the populations of small invertebrates that are vital for the local bird species\u30104:0\u2020source\u3011\u30104:1\u2020source\u3011.\n\nAdditionally, the Apuldram Wastewater Treatment Works (WwTW) is a significant contributor to the Harbour's water quality issues, particularly during heavy rainfall when storm overflows can discharge untreated or partially treated wastewater into the Harbour\u30104:4\u2020source\u3011\u30104:5\u2020source\u3011. The Environment Agency has set measures to mitigate these impacts, including nitrogen permits and reduction strategies for agricultural practices in the surrounding areas\u30104:0\u2020source\u3011\u30104:1\u2020source\u3011.\n\nIn summary, the main pollutants in Chichester Harbour are nutrients (especially nitrates) and faecal bacteria from agricultural runoff and wastewater discharges, which together threaten the ecological balance and water quality of this important habitat\u30104:0\u2020source\u3011\u30104:1\u2020source\u3011.\n\nCitations:\n- \u30104:0\u2020source\u3011: managing_water_quality.txt (ID: file-curIcz2YB7jOquxa9BLiNuXl)\n- \u30104:1\u2020source\u3011: managing_water_quality.txt (ID: file-curIcz2YB7jOquxa9BLiNuXl)\n- \u30104:0\u2020source\u3011: managing_water_quality.txt (ID: file-curIcz2YB7jOquxa9BLiNuXl)\n- \u30104:1\u2020source\u3011: managing_water_quality.txt (ID: file-curIcz2YB7jOquxa9BLiNuXl)\n- \u30104:4\u2020source\u3011: managing_water_quality.txt (ID: file-curIcz2YB7jOquxa9BLiNuXl)\n- \u30104:5\u2020source\u3011: managing_water_quality.txt (ID: file-curIcz2YB7jOquxa9BLiNuXl)\n- \u30104:0\u2020source\u3011: managing_water_quality.txt (ID: file-curIcz2YB7jOquxa9BLiNuXl)\n- \u30104:1\u2020source\u3011: managing_water_quality.txt (ID: file-curIcz2YB7jOquxa9BLiNuXl)\n- \u30104:0\u2020source\u3011: managing_water_quality.txt (ID: file-curIcz2YB7jOquxa9BLiNuXl)\n- \u30104:1\u2020source\u3011: managing_water_quality.txt (ID: file-curIcz2YB7jOquxa9BLiNuXl)\n", "recorded_at": "2024-10-01T14:18:07.747249"}
